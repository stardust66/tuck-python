# tuck-python
Partial demo of the Tuck To Go project made with Flask.

This was made to show a friend that it was easier to work with
Flask, Python, and Heroku than PHP (not saying that one language
is better than the other, it was just that he wasn't even using
modern PHP).

This site basically just lets you register and log in.
